      <h2 class="book-title">2.Kafan</h2>
      <h3 class="book-author"><b>Author :</b> Munshi Premchand </h3>
      <h3 class="book-genre"><b>Genre :</b> Hindi Short Story / Social Realism </h3>

      <h3 class="book-description">
        
<p> <b>Description :</b> 
  Kafan is one of the most powerful and thought-provoking short stories written by Munshi Premchand, a pioneer of modern Hindi and Urdu literature. The story revolves around Ghisu and Madhav, a father and son living in extreme poverty, and the death of Madhav’s wife, Budhiya. Instead of mourning her death or arranging her funeral shroud (kafan), the two men spend the money collected for her last rites on food and alcohol.

At a surface level, Kafan may appear shocking or insensitive. However, Premchand uses this narrative to expose the deep-rooted social, economic, and moral decay caused by poverty, exploitation, and social inequality. The story forces readers to question traditional ideas of morality when survival itself becomes a daily struggle.
</p>
      </h3>

      <h3 class="book-reason">
<p>        <b>Why You Should Read It :</b>
Kafan is highly relevant for students because it:

Provides a realistic portrayal of poverty and social injustice

Encourages critical and ethical thinking

Challenges superficial judgments about right and wrong

Highlights the psychological impact of long-term deprivation

Strengthens understanding of realist literature

For students trying to understand why reading books is important, Kafan shows how literature can reflect harsh social realities and provoke deep thought rather than offer comfort.
</p>
      </h3>

      <p> <b> Relevance for Beginners </b>
Even in 2026, Kafan remains relevant. Poverty, inequality, and social neglect still exist, and the story continues to raise uncomfortable but necessary questions about responsibility, empathy, and societal failure.

For students and readers interested in Hindi literature by Indian authors, Kafan is essential reading.
