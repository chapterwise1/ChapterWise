      <h2 class="book-title">1. Thinking, Fast and Slow</h2>
      <h3 class="book-author"><b>Author :</b> Daniel Kahneman </h3>
      <h3 class="book-genre"><b>Genre :</b>Psychology / Behavioral Economics / Non-Fiction</h3>

      <h3 class="book-description">
<p>         <b>Description :</b>
  Thinking, Fast and Slow is a groundbreaking work by Nobel Prize–winning psychologist Daniel Kahneman that explores how humans think, make decisions, and judge situations. The book introduces two systems of thinking:

System 1: Fast, automatic, intuitive, and emotional

System 2: Slow, deliberate, logical, and analytical

Kahneman explains how these two systems shape our choices, often leading to cognitive biases and errors in judgment without us realizing it. The book combines psychology, economics, and real-life examples to explain why people often act irrationally—even when they believe they are being logical.
