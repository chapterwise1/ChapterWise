      <h2 class="book-title">3. The Courage to Be Disliked</h2>
      <h3 class="book-author"><b>Author :</b> Ichiro Kishimi & Fumitake Koga </h3>
      <h3 class="book-genre"><b>Genre :</b> Self-Help / Psychology / Personal Development </h3>

      <h3 class="book-description">
        <p> <b>Description :</b>
        The Courage to Be Disliked is a modern philosophy and psychology book based on Alfred Adler’s theories, presented in the form of a dialogue between a philosopher and a young man. Instead of giving advice in a traditional self-help style, the book explains ideas through conversation, making complex psychological concepts easy to understand.

The central message of the book is that happiness comes from taking responsibility for our own life choices rather than seeking approval from others. It challenges common beliefs about trauma, past experiences, and social expectations, and emphasizes that people can change their lives by changing their mindset. </p>

      <h2 class="book-title">4. Atomic Habits</h2>
      <h3 class="book-author"><b>Author :</b> James Clear</h3>
      <h3 class="book-genre"><b>Genre :</b> Productivity / Self-Help</h3>

      <h3 class="book-description">
        <p> <b>Description :</b>
      
Atomic Habits is a practical and widely read self-improvement book by James Clear that focuses on how small, consistent habits can lead to remarkable life changes. The word “atomic” refers to habits that are tiny in size but powerful in impact. Instead of promoting sudden transformation, the book explains how long-term success is built through daily systems and routines.
James Clear combines scientific research, real-life examples, and actionable strategies to show how habits are formed, how they work, and how they can be changed. The book introduces a clear framework based on the cue–craving–response–reward loop, making habit formation easy to understand and apply.
        </p>
      </h3>

      <h3 class="book-reason">

        </p>
      </h3>

Another important concept is the 1% rule—improving just 1% every day leads to massive improvement over time. The book also introduces the four laws of behavior change:

Make it obvious

Make it attractive

Make it easy

Make it satisfying

These principles can be applied to studying, fitness, productivity, and personal growth.</p>
